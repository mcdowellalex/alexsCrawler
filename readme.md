### Alex's Crawler

This was a project for a class called "Interactive Software and Hardware". 

The goal was to create a game and learn how to work with microbits. 

The game I created is a cross between a crawler and space invaders. 

The first microbit acts as a receiver and is connected directly to the computer and communicates to the game using a serial connection. The second microbit acts as the controller and sends data to the receiver through radio. The game uses tilt and button functionality to interact and play.

## requirements:
- two BBC microbits
- processing program

## setup:
- install 'microbit-receiver.hex' onto the microbit that is plugged into the computer. To install, simply drag and drop the file onto the source in your file explorer.
- install 'microbit-controller.hex' onto the other microbit. Then unplug that one from the computer and connect to battery power.
- open crawler > crawler.pde in the processing ide, and hit the play button
